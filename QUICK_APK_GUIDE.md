## 📞 **Need Help?**

**If PWA Builder shows errors:**
- ❌ "Does not use HTTPS" → Make sure you're using the Netlify HTTPS URL, not localhost
- ❌ "Manifest not found" → Check that manifest.json loads at your-url.com/manifest.json
- ❌ "Mixed content" → All resources must be HTTPS (automatic with Netlify/Vercel)
- ❌ "Icons required" → Your manifest has icons, this should resolve after proper deployment

**If deployment fails:**
- Check all files in `dist` folder are present (9 files + assets folder)
- Try selecting individual files instead of dragging the folder
- Verify your internet connection
- Try a different hosting service (Vercel, GitHub Pages)

**If PWA Builder still fails:**
- Wait 2-3 minutes after deployment for DNS to propagate
- Test your URL in a browser first - make sure the app loads
- Clear PWA Builder cache and try again
- Check browser console for any errors

**If APK won't install:**
- Enable "Install unknown apps" in Android settings
- Check APK file isn't corrupted (redownload)
- Try installing via file manager
